3D printing took 12h 8' in low quality, 140g after scaling in z to 75% to reduce to 3mm thickness.

Lessons learned: 

* 3mm thickness is enough. Perhaps 4mm is good only where the fixing screws attach the plate to the frame
* 4 screws are enough to fix the plate. Ideally use 10mm M5 screws with phillips or internal hex head and one washer 
* Make open slots instead of holes for ease of installation. 5mm holes are too tight in practice, try 5.2mm
* make raised flanges in the corners of the plate to facilitate aligning the plate to the frame

Next steps: 

* position elements in the plate and holes to fix them.
* make modifications to FreeCAD model

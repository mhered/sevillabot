## Iron

Recommends temperature controlled station and bevel tips

Maintenance: keep the tip clean with steel wool

## Solder

Usually tin leaded and unleaded. 

Leaded is easier to work with, needs lower temperature (various recommendations 300-400C) but lead is poisonous so wash your hands and have good ventilation e.g. ventilator at your back

## Flux

Stops formation of oxide layer

Two types of Flux: active is corrosive, you need to clean it quickly

Passive: non corrosive (Rosin type). 

Flux comes actually in a channel or core inside the soldering wire

## Soldering wires

Recommends stranded core (easier to handle) and silicon coated (won't melt and easier to strip). 

Tinning the wire: strip off 5mm, twist the strands, then heat the wire with the iron and melt some solder onto it, enough to cover the strands and keep them together

Never melt the solder on the iron then transfer to the part, the flux will get used too early + the part will be cold!

Slide the heat shrink on one end

Move parts together and melt the solder with additional solder

cover with the heat shrink, heat it centre first then ends to avoid trapping air bubbles

## Soldering a pin onto a board

Use the iron to heat the parts (board and pin) then melt the solder on it

Again, never melt the solder on the iron then transfer 

Clean residue of rosin with alcohol

Adding flux will reduce surface tension and make the solder "wet" the surfaces better.

## Soldering a wire onto a pin hole

Prep the hole: heat up then add solder 

strip 2mm, tin the wire

solder

(See details in crash course video)

## Mistakes

never add the solder to the iron

less is more (unless breadboard pins due to mechanical stress and power pins due to high current)
